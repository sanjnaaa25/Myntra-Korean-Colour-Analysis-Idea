    <div class="season">
        <h1>Are you a Spring/Autumn Warm? Or a<br> Summer/Winter Cool?</h1>

        <p>Now that you have an idea of warm versus cool – what season are you? If you’re a warm tone, it’ll be<br>  between spring or autumn. If you’re cool-toned you’ll be summer or winter.</p>

        <p>To see which season tone you are, try putting your hand on top of these colors and see which one makes <br> your skin look brighter and feels more flattering. Observe if your skin looks washed out and dull against<br>  a color.</p>
